## Problem Statement:
**Domain:** Hospitality  
**Function:** Revenue

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate ‚ÄúBusiness and Data Intelligence‚Äù to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Task:
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.
1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## üí° What this dashboard offers:
- A 360-degree analysis of revenue, occupancy, cancellations, and ratings for Atliq Grands properties.
- Insights on top-performing properties, weekly revenue trends, and customer preferences.
- Innovative visuals to make data exploration seamless and engaging.

## üìö New Learnings:
- DAX formulas like `WEEKNUM`, `WEEKDAY`, and `HASONEFILTER`.
- Creating calendar tables to streamline time-based analysis.
- Transforming a matrix visual into an insightful heatmap.
- Leveraging new card visuals for detailed metrics display.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard:
1. Atliq Exotica stands out as the top contributor to revenue across all properties.
2. Mumbai leads the revenue generation with a total of 669M, while Delhi records the lowest at 105M.
3. Delhi boasts the highest occupancy rate at 61%, compared to Bangalore‚Äôs lowest occupancy at 56%.
4. The Luxury category outperforms the Business category in terms of revenue generation.
5. Among the room types, Elite Rooms achieve the highest number of bookings, whereas Presidential Rooms record the lowest.
6. Mumbai experienced a significant revenue loss of 116M due to cancellations.
7. Presidential  Rooms in Mumbai generate the highest Average Revenue per Day at 19K.
8. Revenue peaked during Week 29, reaching 139.7M, while Week 26 recorded the lowest at 114.2M.
9. Atliq Blu and Atliq Exotica feature the longest average stay duration of 2.8 days, while Atliq City has the shortest at 1.8 days.
10. Atliq Seasons holds the lowest average rating of 2.3, while Atliq Blu has the highest with a rating of 3.9.

## Next Steps:
